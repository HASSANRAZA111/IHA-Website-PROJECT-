# IHA WEBSITE PROJECT 
Moreover,giI was tasked with this project by the AUSES Society, where I led workshops on web development. In this capacity, I created a captivating website consisting of a single home page, meticulously designed using HTML and CSS. Leveraging a combination of intriguing transitions, dynamic transformations, captivating animations, and innovative designs, I aimed to deliver an immersive user experience.

The home page was conceptualized and developed with careful attention to detail, ensuring seamless navigation and visual appeal. Each element, from the transitions that seamlessly guide users through the website to the transformations that enhance the layout's aesthetics, was implemented with precision.
